# TET_start
Here we will start to get used to the GIT.

## What would we do?
1. Install git, run some commands.
2. Install android studio (it's better to install 2021.3.1 version, https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/install/2021.3.1.17/android-studio-2021.3.1.17-windows.exe), flutter (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows) and Visual Studio Code (done).
